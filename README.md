# SORTING-VISUALIZER

Sorting.Visualizer is a web app for visualizing a bunch of different sorting algorithms Like Selection Sort,
Bubble Sort,
Insertion Sort,
Merge Sort,
Quick Sort
With the functionality of ‚è≥(Processing Speed Control) and üìè(Array Size Control).

# HOW IT WORKS

Here in our model, each element value is represented by THE ARRAY SIZE As 5,....100 and SPEED as 0.50x,...,4.00x and we can also select which algorithm we want and the algorithms sort them by placing the smallest elements on the left and the biggest elements on the right as bar graph.

The algorithms moves the items around by swapping elements, Without using any addational memory with creating another array.
